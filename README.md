## Surprise me
"Surprise me" chooses a random command from the "random.txt" file and executes it. You can edit the "random.txt" file to get more personalized results! You'll have to follow some specific syntax, however, but take a look at the file and try it out!



## Quit
The "quit" command will exit the application. 



#### All commands will return to the original app interface to allow for multiple searches during the same session. Enjoy the app!
